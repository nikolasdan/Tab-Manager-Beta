# Tab-Manager-Beta

A Tab Manager webapp that represents the tabs in a graphical way.


<h1>Usage:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>npm i (installs dependencies)</li>
    <li>npm start (will open app on localhost:3000)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Execute the commands in order to not encounter any problems</h3>

<h1>Tools I used:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>React.JS;</li>
    <li>react-dnd (for drag and drop). I used this one instead of cytoscape-drag-and-drop because it was easier to implement;</li>
    <li>uuid (for unique id). This one is for creating automaticaly an ID for an object or group;</li>
    <li>lodash (helps me by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc);</li>
    <li>Bootstrap for UI. I have experience with this and it's easier to work with.</li>
</ul> 

<h1>Known bugs:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>deleting items only in the default group</li>
    <li>deleting groups not working</li>
    <li>when reloading the page everything is deleted (groups and items)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Working features:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Adding a url to a group</li>
    <li>Redirect to the url in another tab</li>
    <li>Creating a group</li>
    <li>Moving items in other groups</li>
    <li>Deleting items</li>
    <li>Deleting groups (not working..)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Features that should have been implemented but didn't had time to implement (because of bugs and school):</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Creating new workspaces</li>
    <li>Representing groups as tabs in a workspace</li>
    <li>Saving everything localy</li>
</ul>


<h1>Other:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>The project didn't turn out as complex as I wanted but it was fun</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Thanks for the opportunity!</p></li>
</ul>

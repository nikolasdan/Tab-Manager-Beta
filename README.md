<h1>Usage:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>npm i (installs dependencies)</li>
    <li>npm start (will open the app on localhost:3000)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Tools I used:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>React.JS;</li>
    <li>react-dnd (for drag and drop). I used this one instead of cytoscape-drag-and-drop because it was easier to implement;</li>
    <li>uuid (for unique id). This one is for creating automaticaly an ID for an object or group;</li>
    <li>lodash (helps me by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc);</li>
    <li>Bootstrap for UI. I have experience with this and it's easier to work with.</li>
</ul>
